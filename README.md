# Tyler-Assignment-14
Final Assignment Coders Campus Bootcamp

Tech used:
- Java
- Javascript
- Thymeleaf
- Spring
- Maven

This assignment taught me more about vanilla Javascript and how to integrate it into fullstack applications. 
Although a database was optional for this assignment, I can easily implement one with Hibernate and MySQL to persist changes.
